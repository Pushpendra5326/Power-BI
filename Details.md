**Challenge OverView**
We are exploring the new card visual that was released in few months ago. Key metrics are frequently displayed in reports, and in the past it took a combination of cards, images, and other visuals. Thanks to the new card visual, we now have more flexibility, options for dynamic customization, and support for multiple fields.

Today’s challenge we’ll display a few key metrics from the inbuilt sample dataset using the new card visual. I’ll present a few options, but feel free to play around with the design and selected metrics.
